![Unexpected gopher](gopher.png)

This small site, still under construction, is oriented to developers learning
[golang](https://golang.org) that want to see the _unexpected_, at least for a
newcomer, behaviors in the language.

This examples expect that reader is familiar with the language. 

If you're not familiar with it, you should complete the [Go by
Example](https://gobyexample.com/) tutorial.

# Examples 

The WIP list of examples is:
 - [Goroutines on `for` loop values](goroutines-on-loops.html)
 - [There's no `Min(int, int)` int function](theres-no-min-function.html)
 - [`nil` errors that are non-nil
   `error`s](nil-errors-that-are-non-nil-errors.html)
 - [`time.RFC3339` constant is not a valid `RFC3339`
   timestmap](time-rfc3339-is-not-a-valid-rfc3339.html)
 - [`os.Stdout` changes after `init()` in testable
   examples](os-stdout-changes-after-init-in-examples.html)
   
# Disclaimer 
   
   This examples are not trying to prove that golang is _wrong_, it's just
   sharing stuff that someone who has just started learning the language doesn't
   expect.
