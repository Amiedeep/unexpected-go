tagline: Golang code with unexpected behaviors
description: Showcase of unexpected golang behaviors
---

This small site, still under construction, is oriented to developers 
learning [golang](https://golang.org) that want to see the _unexpected_, 
at least for a newcomer, behaviors in the language.

This examples don't include the lack of generics or a `min(int, int) int` function 
in the language, and they expect that reader is familiar with the language. 

If you're not familiar with it, you should complete the [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)
tutorial. 

The WIP list of examples is:
 - [Goroutines on `for` loop values](goroutines-on-loops.html)
