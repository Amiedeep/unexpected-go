This small site, still under construction, is oriented to developers
learning [golang](https://golang.org) that want to see the _unexpected_,
at least for a newcomer, behaviors in the language.

This examples expect that reader is familiar with the language. 

If you're not familiar with it, you should complete the [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)
tutorial.

The WIP list of examples is:
 - [Goroutines on `for` loop values](goroutines-on-loops.html)
 - [There's no `Min(int, int)` int function](theres-no-min-function.html)
